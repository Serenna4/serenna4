## 🚀 About Me 
I am an environmental data analyst professional with experience in field work, GIS, R, Python, Excel, statistics, and data-driven environmental research. I have a special interest in agriculture, forestry, wildfire management, and ranching. 

I am currently working on a master’s degree in Data Science and hold two bachelor’s degrees in Environmental Science and Data Science from Willamette University. At the heart of my work is a commitment to making a difference for people, community, and the beautiful world around us. My recent experience includes urban stream management, research in database development in R, field collection in ArcGIS Field Maps, and volunteer work for the 4-H youth development program.
